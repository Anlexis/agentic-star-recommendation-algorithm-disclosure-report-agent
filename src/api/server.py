# agent's secrets across two stores: a key provisioned for the registry
# deployment is simply absent in the standalone one, with no error at boot,
# because a missing tier file is ignored by design.
# `namespace` is lower(industry) — "ret" — not the lowercased template id.
# tests/integration/test_manifest_identity_alignment.py holds both values to the
# manifest; it reads both sides rather than restating either.

# ── Structured-parameter credential screen ───────────────────────────────────
# Why this runs before invoke() rather than inside a node:
#
# The framework's mandatory output gate scans every value of every node result
# for credential patterns, and the backbone's first node copies the structured
# parameters verbatim into its own result. So a credential-shaped string
# anywhere in them makes the FIRST node of the graph fail, before any template
# code runs. What the caller receives is an error status with the domain result
# withheld and no explanation — nothing names the parameter, the field, or the
# reason. On a hosted conversation the same context is replayed every turn, so
# the session never recovers on its own.
#
# "This template only declares inert fields" is not immunity on its own: a
# validator that IGNORES an undeclared key leaves it in the context, where it
# still reaches that first node. This template's contract refuses unknown keys
# rather than ignoring them, and this screen is the second half of the same
# answer — it runs before invoke(), so the refusal is a 400 naming the field
# rather than an opaque node-1 error.
#
# The screen calls the SAME detector the framework gate calls, on the SAME
# assembled object, so what this adapter refuses and what the gate blocks are
# one set by construction — there is no local pattern list that could drift from
# it. Scanning field by field composes exactly to scanning the whole mapping
# (the detector on a mapping is the union over its values), which is what lets
# the refusal name the offending field without widening or narrowing the match.
#
# Field NAMES are caller-controlled too, so a name is repeated back only when it
# is short and inert; anything else is reported by position. The rejected value
# and the matched text are never echoed, in the response or in the audit record.
